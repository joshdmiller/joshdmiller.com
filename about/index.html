    <div class="post-content">
        <p>
        For the impatient: scientist, rationalist, skeptic, leader, 
        technologist, businessman, radical.
        </p>

        <p>
        For the rest of you, I am an atypically avid reader with a passion for science and a
        proponent of the greater understanding and application of science,
        philosophy, and critical thinking within the public sphere. In addition
        to various physical and social sciences texts, I regularly read the
        journals <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org">Science</a> and <a href="http://www.aibs.org/bioscience">BioScience</a> and the periodicals 
        <a href="http://www.sciam.com">Scientific American</a> and <a href="http://www.archaeology.org">Archaeology</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
        I firmly believe in using an evidence-based approach to most aspects of
        our private and public lives, such as in policy, in medicine, and in
        business. In addition to applying these principals internally, we should also
        apply them externally when examining the claims of others. As the late Carl Sagan said,
        "extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof".
        </p>

        <p>
        I also believe in measuring both our successes and our failures and using the
        knowledge gained from each to improve ourselves and our society, as well as
        introducing (and reinforcing) accountability in our communities.
        </p>

        I am a California native who works throughout the state, but is currently in 
        Northern California as Managing Partner of Gestalt Data Services, LLC.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Lastly, reflecting my interests in science and public policy, I am a
        professional member of the 
        <a href="http://www.aaas.org">American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)</a>, the 
        <a href="http://www.aibs.org">American Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS)</a>,
        and the <a href="http://www.psqonline.org/?redir=%2F04aps_about.htm "Academy of Political Science"">Academy of Political Science (APS)</a>.

    <h2 class="post-title">What do I do?</h2>
    <div class="post-content">

        <p>
        Simply speaking, I run technology projects for business executives.
        More specifically, I manage the full project lifecycle of complex
        initiatives impacting enterprise-wide information technology, sales and
        marketing programs, and business intelligence initiatives in the
        web, biomed, and education verticals.
        </p>

        <p>
        I am described by my colleagues as a strong analyzer, strategic
        planner, and decisive leader and I have a strong track record for
        developing emerging concepts into high-performance realities that
        reduce costs, boost profits, and build corporate value.
        </p>

        <p>
        My first personal computer was a 1980s Apple II that had no internal
        hard drive and ran off 3.5" floppies. Today, my desktop has a terabyte
        of storage space - nearly 6 orders of magnitude larger than the Apple.
        I have strong enthusiasm for applying this exponential technology curve
        to solve business problems, from simple business process management
        such as replacing manual spreadsheet processes with an integrated
        technology stack, to creating business intelligence through the
        establishment of an enterprise data warehouse.
        </p>

        <p>
        In keeping with this enthusiasm, I am an avid supporter of open-source
        technology and open standards. As such, a common theme of my career has
        been spearheading the adoption of open-standards and agile development
        methodologies to produce products of higher quality than, with the same
        level of professional support as its proprietary-standards equivalent
        -- but with a total cost of ownership 60-80% less. Some examples
        include migration of IT infrastructure to
        commercially-supported Linux, the adoption of open-source data
        integration tools (such as Pentaho and Talend),
        and the extensive use of open development systems (such
        as PHP and Java).
