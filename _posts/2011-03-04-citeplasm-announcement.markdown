At GDS, we just kicked off a new public project with this working logo:

Citeplasm is a best-in-class research and collaboration tool for academic
professionals and small businesses. It provides a one-stop solution for
locating sources of information, managing the citation of those sources,
maintaining an interactive database of the user's notes and ideas related back
to sources, and a comprehensive suite of tools to assist in the conception,
drafting, and management of academic & professional papers.

At GDS, we are pretty excited about this project and are looking forward to
launching a public beta in January 2012. In the coming weeks and months, I'll
keep everyone updated about our progress and perhaps post some information on
Citeplasm's architecture for those interested in the creation of cloud-based
applications. After all, everything we do at GDS is open-source!
