Welcome to my new website! This is a radical change in design from light blues
and whites to dark grays with pastel accents. My old website was a
[Pylons][pylons] ([Python][python]) application with a custom blog engine where
the articles were stored in HTML. This site, however, is in
[Scalatra][scalatra] ([Scala][scala]) and the articles are stored in
[Markdown][markdown] for greater versatility.

Unfortunately, this means I cannot directly import my old blog entries. I will
be migrating some of the more interesting ones over the next few days, however.
I the meantime, I apologize for the bareness.

I hope you enjoy the new site - and keep in touch.
