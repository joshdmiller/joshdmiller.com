After much ado, the Citeplasm Wiki is live! Though there is not much
information currently available, it will soon be populated with design
documentation. As Citeplasm is a consumer product, the wiki is hosted under
Emergenesis' domain [here](http://wiki.emergenesis.com/Citeplasm).

For those who are unaware, Emergenesis is the consumer division of Gestalt Data
Services and follows all GDS policies and procedures regarding open-source.
Therefore, the copyright to Citeplasm's source code is owned by the Gestalt
Foundation, Inc.
