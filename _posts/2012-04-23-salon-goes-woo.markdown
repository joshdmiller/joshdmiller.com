I was intrigued when I opened Salon's daily email yesterday to discover an
article filed in the Neuroscience category entitled "Near death, explained: New
science is shedding light on what really happens during out-of-body experiences
-- with shocking results." Shocking results - how exciting! I clicked on the
article from my cell phone and began reading.

And then was quickly disappointed.

Unfortunately, this article was not about new discoveries in neuroscience. Nor
was it about "new science". Nor even about science at all, really. Instead, the
article was a collection of unconvincing anecdotes strung together with
less-than-stellar logic. For anyone interested, I suggest [reading the article
in full](http://www.salon.com/2012/04/21/near_death_explained/singleton/), but
I'll cover some of the more troublesome aspects of the article herein.

<!-- more -->

The author of the article, Mario Beauregard, first acknowledges the problem
of independent corroboration and then tells a story of a social worker whose
patient reported during a near-death experience leaving her body and floating
above the hospital, where she noticed a shoe on the roof of the building. The
social worker checked, and surely enough, there was a shoe on the roof! With
regard to the shoe, Mr Beauregard says: 

> Quite skeptical, \[the social worker\] Clark went to the location described
> by \[the patient\] Maria—and found the tennis shoe. From the window of her
> hospital room, the details that Maria had recounted could not be discerned.
> But upon retrieval of the shoe, Clark confirmed Maria’s observations.

Wait, what? Even if we take the story at face value and look into it no further
whatsoever, the story itself still seems weak: she looked out the window of the
patient's hospital room and -- not "couldn't see the shoe" -- but "the details
couldn't be discerned". So, she could in fact see the shoe from the window of
the hospital room?

But aside from unconvincing anecdotes, the article also threw up a few red
flags. At one point, the author says:

> Despite corroborated reports, many materialist scientists cling to the
> notion that OBEs and NDEs are located in the brain.

And later in the article:

> Materialistic scientists have proposed a number of physiological
> explanations to account for the various features of NDEs.

"Materialist scientists" is a giant red flag. For those not used to it, a quick
explanation: there's no such thing. There are scientists and there are not
scientists. The phrase "materialist scientists" is thrown by those promoting
things not grounded in science at scientists who demand evidence. And, for the
record, despite the implication otherwise in the phrase, there is a difference
between methodological materialism, on which the scientific method is based,
and philosophical materialism, on which it is not. But I digress.

Another red flag from the article is the balance of arguments; the author
mentions in a single sentence possible physiological explanations only to spend
a couple of paragraphs refuting them. For example, he briefly mentions the
anoxic brain injury hypothesis:

> British psychologist Susan Blackmore has propounded the “dying brain”
> hypothesis: that a lack of oxygen (or anoxia) during the dying process
> might induce abnormal firing of neurons in brain areas responsible for
> vision, and that such an abnormal firing would lead to the illusion of
> seeing a bright light at the end of a dark tunnel.

And then spends the next three paragraphs saying why he doesn't think so. Which
would be fine for an op-ed, but not for an article in a category called
"neuroscience".

For what it's worth, Mario Beauregard is a known quantity. He has good
credentials and, unlike many, he's published, but he's an intelligent design
proponent who believes in dualism, wherein the physical brain is controlled to
some degree by an independent "mind" that operates at a quantum level.

This is not acceptable journalism and, above all else, it does not belong in a
category labelled "neuroscience" where readers, myself included, assume that
that articles would contain fair reporting and would be science-based. This was
all a little too "Huffington Post" for my taste, so I unsubscribed from the email
list in frustration.

Which is sad, as last year it gave me a great recipe for brown butter brownies.
