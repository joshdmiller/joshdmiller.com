I was at a holiday party recently where some children and a few adults
were showing off a Power Balance Bracelet; I had never heard of this particular
magic amulet, so I agreed to a demonstration. A young teenager gave me a "push
test". I was asked to stand on only one leg while a relatively gentle push to my
shoulders was administered. I was given the bracelet, and the test was repeated.

"See?" The proponent argued. "Don't you feel more balanced?"

I admit I did feel more balanced during the admittedly unscientific push test
while wearing the bracelet. And so I proverbially put on my critical thinking
hat and pondered the result. Could it be the weight of the object like a
tight rope walker and his pole? Was I unintentionally pushed lighter as the
pusher knew I was wearing the bracelet? Was it all, so to speak, “in my
head”?

There was no shortage of explanations from its users. One believer proffered the
hypothesis he recollected: the bracelets gather the negative ions from your body
and send them out to the environment in discrete pulses. Another insisted they
worked by balancing the human body's “natural energy field” (the words “chi” and
“chakra” came to mind but were never mentioned). And another did not know how it
worked but was sure it did as he heard NASA gives these bracelets to its
astronauts before rocketing above Earth.

# Investigating

As these explanations were hardly satisfactory, I retreated to a quiet corner
of the room during a break in conversation and frantically searched the web
from my phone for anything about these bracelets. Other than the endless stream
of celebrity endorsements, there were few-to-no sites that expressed praise for
the magic bracelets. I did find quite a few skeptic sites describing
double-blind experiments performed on these devices, all of which demonstrated
no benefit. But let's go to the source.

According to the Power Balance website, the bracelets contain a Mylar hologram.
For those who are unaware, Mylar is a trade name of the human-engineered
biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate, or BoPET. BoPET is the polyester
film out of which those grocery store balloons are made; it is also what covers
standard tape measures, seals yoghurt containers, and packages convenience
foods. So, why Mylar? I searched around a few days later and was unable to find
any reason why a Mylar hologram was essential to their process.

These "Mylar holograms", according to their website, are "embedded with
frequencies". What? A "frequency" is a measurement of the count of something per
unit time. "Frequency" is how often something occurs; to "embed a frequency" is
as meaningless as "embedding a velocity" - nothing has been communicated
because, though the words are all real, they are meaningless within the context
they were used. To put it another way, automobile print artichoke - got it?

But they were not alone in making such silly claims. As it turns out, a few days
later, I happened upon a television commercial for the “iRenew” bracelet, which,
though it looks different, seems to promise fundamentally similar results.
According to their website, the iRenew bracelet works by “bringing your BioField
to a more balanced state”. What's a BioField?  Beats me. But according to them,
a BioField “is an integral part of your whole being” and “is in close balance
with every aspect of your self”, but they provide no further detail. As silly as
the claim “although it seems like magic, it is actually science!” may be, my
favorite claim on their website is that electromagnetic radiation and
electromagnetic fields are “unnatural”.

# Testing

After completing my research, I re-entered the party floor and navigated to the
group discussing the bracelets. Being a skeptic and a scientist, my first
instinct was not to miss the so-called “teachable moment” - and with a dozen
children and teenagers present I believe passing such an opportunity would
nearly be criminal.

My proposal to the group was to do some quick and dirty double-blind tests of
the effect by which the group was most impressed: as one believer put it, “you
become like a pillar”. It was my hope that the results of these tests, while
certainly not well-designed and the results of which would not be statistically
significant, would provide some room for doubt about the bracelet's efficacy.

To test the balance gains, a minor girl named Rebecca was blindfolded and one
person placed the bracelet (or a similar Live Strong bracelet) over Rebecca's
long sleeve while another administered the (very unscientific) push test.

During the first round, Rebecca could not determine which was the Power
Bracelet. The group of believers then objected, proffering the theory that the
bracelet must touch the skin to be effective, though they didn't know why.
After initial resistance due to the slightly different shapes of the two
bracelets and the subjects' familiarity with the device, I relented and Rebecca
was again blindfolded.

And again, she could not determine which was the Power Bracelet.

The tests did not yield the results I so naively expected; instead of the group
finding curiosity in the powerful effects of placebo and confirmation bias, the
tests only led to polarization of the groups' attitudes. The minority who
believed the magic bracelets did not work as described walked away more firm in
their belief and with a small smile on their faces while the majority left not
only firmer in their conviction but also with contempt for the arrogance of
those who disbelieved.

# What's Going on Here?

I was not surprised by the group's lack of critical thinking. We are all
familiar with Americans' scary lack of knowledge when it comes to the big ticket
science items like the 68% of Americans who reject evolution by natural
selection or the 49% who doubt anthropogenic climate change; I believe these are
begat from the general lack of awareness of the insanely high percentage of
scientists across all disciplines who accept these two ideas - 84% and 98%,
respectively ([Pew 2009][pewscience]). My real fear comes from the less
discussed statistics, like 25% of Americans believe in the predictive power of
astrology, 18% have seen a ghost ([Pew 2009][pewfaiths]), and other statistics of
interest that are not from ignorance but rather from a lack of critical
thinking.

So I was not surprised that the group as a whole thought neither critically nor
skeptically about the magic bracelets. I was however surprised by the
**ferocity** of their belief. All things being equal, these bracelets are either
an athletic tool or a fashion statement and which is the correct perspective is
ultimately trivial and totally irrelevant to the average person's life. Yet when
challenged, the group's brains largely shut down and I was suddenly challenging
the existence of the [dragon in their garage][dragon]. If we cannot openly
listen to someone proposing tests to show that something that doesn't matter
doesn't work, how are we to do the same for the things that do matter?

Americans' level of general science knowledge is among the lowest of all
industrialized nations. Interstitial advertisements on the web and on
television are full of products claiming varied salubrious outcomes, from
increased energy to weight loss to immunity boosting. These have been on
television for years, so either advertisers are very stupid or people actually 
buy their products. These ads come with the [Quack Miranda Warning][miranda].
People are willing to buy products to treat a condition when the ad 
(not to mention the package) specifically says it is not intended to treat any
condition. Would these people still see a physician who prefaced all his advice
with "these statements have not been evaluated by the FDA" and all his
prescriptions with "what I am about to prescribe is not intended to treat, 
diagnose, prevent, or cure any disease"?

While on the subject TV pseudoscience, I cannot leave out the Discovery and
History channels. For all the infotainment programs like Dirty Jobs and
Deadliest Catch and genuinely informative programs like the popular MythBusters
and Modern Marvels, there is a lot of just plain garbage, like Discovery's
ridiculous Ghost Lab and History's laughable Ancient Aliens, not to mention the
one-off specials like the Moon Landing Hoax. All this in addition to cable news
discussions littered with paranoid fantasies about victory mosques, birth
certificates, concentration camps, and controlled demolitions.

But I digress.

# A Word About Skepticism

People seem to think skepticism is closed-minded and that its practitioners
believe in nothing and seek to disprove all things. While I am fond of the old
joke that if one is too open-minded her brain will fall out, it would seem to
me that in reality, skepticism is the most open-minded of all perspectives.
Skepticism starts only with openness but demands a fair analysis of available
data and adheres closely to the view popularized by Carl Sagan that
extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

I think I am comfortable speaking for most self-described skeptics when I say
that we do not want the “paranormal” to be disproved. On the contrary, for any
scientist, how awe-inspiring, mind-bending, and absolutely thrilling would it
be to make a simple discovery that would turn a field or two of science on its
head?

But let's have some evidence, please.
