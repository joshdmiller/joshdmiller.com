Today is Charles Darwin's (and Abraham Lincoln's) birthday, making this
International Darwin Day. In celebration, I will be posting throughout the day
on the topic of Charles Darwin (and of evolution in general) on my
[Twitter][twitter] and [Google+][gplus] feeds.

resonant, and socially important scientific theory to date. Its consequences
are far-reaching and its controversy always near.
